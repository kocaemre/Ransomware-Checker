# Ransomware Checker

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## About

Ransomware Checker is a web application that allows users to analyze files for potential ransomware threats. The application provides a modern, responsive UI for uploading and checking files securely.

## Features

- User-friendly file upload interface with drag and drop functionality
- Secure file analysis process
- Detailed results showing whether files are safe or potentially infected
- User accounts for tracking and saving scan results
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
